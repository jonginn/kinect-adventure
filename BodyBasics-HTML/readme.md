# The Kinect Madeon Misadventure Machine

Use your body and up to 5 friend's bodies to make Madeon noises!

Uses imagery and sounds from [Madeon's Adventure Machine](http://www.madeon.fr/adventuremachine/), which sounds MUCH better than this one and is made by [people who know what they're doing](http://wemakeawesomesh.it).

Created at Kinect Hack London March 2015.
